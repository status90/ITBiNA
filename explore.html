			    <h4>School of Computing and Infomatics</h4>
			    <p>School of Computing and Informatics (SCI) was originated from the Department of Computing and Information Systems that was established in 1986 when Institut Teknologi Brunei (ITB) was still at its infancy. It was then made one of the department under the School of Business and Management in 2003. When ITB was upgraded to a university in 2008, it became a program area under the Faculty of Business and Computing. Recognising the rapid growth in the fields of dedicated computing systems and creative informatics, SCI was formed in 2014 and consists of three Program Areas: Computer and Information Systems (CIS), Computer Network Security (CNS) and Creative Computing (CC).</p>

				<p>As part of the journey to the Universityâ€™s aspiration to become a ranked engineering and technology university, our mission is to produce graduates with exceptional life-long-skills and relevant competencies through innovative teaching and research. Our school has successfully produced excellent programmers, software engineers and industrial leaders and we will continue to be the main drivers in areas of strategic importance nationally and globally.</p>

				<p></p>Our school is currently offering 5 undergraduate programs and postgraduate degree by research.</p>
